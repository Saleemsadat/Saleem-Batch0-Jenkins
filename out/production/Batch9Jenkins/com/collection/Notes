why Not use local computer / latops to host the websites?
1) I have to keep my laptop/computer on all the times
2)I have to make sure my laptop is secure all the time.
3) I have to make sure my latop/desktop is always connected to power and internet.
for these reasons we use servers.
Always connected to power and high speed internet
Special layers of physical security
SDLC:
1) BA collects the requirements from the client and creates software requirement specification SRS.
2) Architects will create the software design document
3) Developers develop the code on local computers / latops once ready they run test cases and once all the test cases are passed they will requst the IT
department to deploy this cod to Dev Server. (Deploy: picking the application / website from local computer and place it on development servers and giving it a URL
so that it can be accessed the audience)
4) QA will request IT for devops team to deploy the code on QA servers
will very the change --- QAs are not involved in deployment process but we will write an email to devops that the changes are made by the dev tema can you
deploy on QA server. Make sure the changes the dev team says they added are there. Sometimes changes are not incorporated.
QA will verify the change and start testing it.
5) once everthing is tested on QA server, application is deployed on staggin server.
6) if required application is deployed on performance and security servers.
7) once testing is completed on stagging, it will be deployed on UAT Servers.
8) production server
